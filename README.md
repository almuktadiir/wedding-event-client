# About Project Features & Functionalities

- User Authentication: Using firebase to improve the authentication system, allowing users to log in, sign up, and manage their accounts.

- Hooks: Use React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage component state and side effects in functional components. Hooks have made it easier to work with state and lifecycle methods.

- Error Handling: Implement error boundaries to gracefully handle and display errors in application without crashing the entire UI.

- Event Handling: Implement event handlers to respond to user interactions such as clicks, input changes, and keyboard events.

- Using Context API: React js Context API is a feature that allows to manage state and share data and functions between components without the need for explicit prop drilling. It's particularly useful when I have multiple nested components that need access to certain data or functionality.
